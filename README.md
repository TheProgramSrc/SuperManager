### Plugin Manager
> This module won't get any preview nor "promotion", it currently just disables/enables plugins but is not recommended to be used because is using code that is not allowed by the Bukkit API, when disabling a plugin is forcing the server to unload it when it was developed to be unloaded only when the server is stopped/restarted.
